1. **How long are you doing this for?**
    We aren’t sure! At least for the next 1-2 years (2019-2021), we want to have enough time to experience all of the places in the contiguous 48 that we might want to move to, as well as see all the sights along the way.

2. **Are you coming back to Vegas?**
    Yes, we will periodically come back for doctor’s appts, smog checks, etc. We’ll update the page when we have a plan to return. (edit: Since COVID-19, we're not sure on this!)

3. **Woah, did you sell the house?**
    Yes! It took a while, but we finally sold the house in October of 2019.

4. **Cole’s Law Brakers?**
   Yeah, you know, you’ve heard of Poe’s Law, Murphy’s Law, but did you hear of Cole’s Law?.............. It’s thinly sliced cabbage, usually in a mayonnaise based dressing! All the full time RVers we’ve seen have hokey names for themselves, we figure we gotta do it too.
