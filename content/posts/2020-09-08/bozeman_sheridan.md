### Bozeman, Montana

We stayed in 2 separate RV parks in Bozeman, as we couldn't find a continuous reservation available. Our first 2 days, we were at the Bozeman Hot Springs and Campground, but unfortunately we did not try the hot springs as they were busy with people not distancing or wearing masks. There was a playground right near our site though, so Ezri really enjoyed going there each day.

After that, we moved to Bear Canyon Campground for the rest of our stay, on the Southeast side of Bozeman. Being a little ways outside of town was less than ideal, as we found that most roads around Bozeman don't have much, if any, shoulder. Right near us was a road that dead ended, but you could only get about 2 miles out before it ended. Overall, there were some good trails, but they were more mountain bike than manicured, and not well connected.

Bozeman has a great walkable downtown with good restaurants, so that was a definite plus. Parking could be a little challenging, but that comes with a more populous area.\

We went to the Museum of the Rockies twice while in Bozeman, Ezri has been really obsessed with bones lately (learning their names, asking if other people/animals have them, wanting me to take mine out so she can touch them, you know, normal stuff). Luckily they have a big collection of dinosaur bones, as well as reptile exhibits and an old homestead to tour. There's also a planetarium star show, and with limited capacity due to distancing, we had to plan our second visit specifically to make the show. We got about 2 minutes in when the darkness and video of the inside of your head made Ezri too freaked out to continue. Maybe we'll try a show like that again in a few years.

There are some great hiking trails in the surrounding area, so we picked a short, 1 mile out and back to see if Ezri will tolerate the hiking pack we have. Last time we used it, about a year and a half ago, she was too upset by being restricted and screamed until she fell asleep. This time, she fully understood the concept of being comfortably carried, loved the view from up high, and has been asking to hike again frequently.

Bozeman tends to be a little drier than I want for plants and gardening, and the land prices are also a bit higher than we'd like. We're pretty sure it's off the list for future places to live.

### Sheridan, Wyoming

The drive from Bozeman to Sheridan was supposed to be right within our regular pull, just shy of 4 hours drive time with a stop at the halfway point taking it to 4.5ish. This was not in the cards for us, unfortunately, and we ended up having to stop an additional 3 times for potty breaks (2 of them false alarms). Our total time ended up being a little over 6 hours, so we all arrived a teensy bit grumpy. Luckily, our reserved site was a pull-through, which is super easy to get the RV into. We lucked out too, that we were right next to the playground in the park, so Ezri had a lot of fun during our stay.

There are paved paths that cover a good amount of the city, but with highs in the upper 90s to over 100, we didn't get out on them many times.

The downtown is walkable and has some nice restaurants, one of which has a aquaponics installation we really liked. It's the first time we've seen a setup that had taken looks into account, and Ezri loved watching the fish in the bottom of it. Definitely going to be filing that away for future consideration once we have a house, as I think something like that could go well on our back porch.

With the high heat and dry climate, Sheridan is also going to be out of the running for our final home, but we enjoyed our time there for sure.

After Sheridan, we drove 3 hours to Spearfish, South Dakota (for a two-day stay before Deadwood / Lead), with, thankfully, only 1 potty break.
