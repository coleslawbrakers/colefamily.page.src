### Southeast Michigan (Nov 14 - May 1)

Hey friends! It's been a wee bit longer than I'd thought since we last had an update. We had a great time in Milan, Michigan (close to Emily in Saline and near Ann Arbor). Ezri had an exciting joint birthday with her cousin Vera, complete with balloons. She now thinks anytime she has a balloon, we have to get one for Vera too.

We all got together for Christmas as well. While we didn't get to have the usual celebration with all of my siblings and parents, we were very glad to be near my sister Emily and her crew. Ezri got entirely too many presents of course, and we had to rearrange her room to fit it all.

Our friends, David and Cindy Parent, and their kids live just about a half hour to the South of Milan in Sylvania Ohio, so after much discussion of safety, we were able to visit with them over the Winter and Spring as well. We used to see them all the time when they lived in Las Vegas, so it was great to get together again. They know the owners of a trampoline park, so they also found out the best, least busy time to go bounce around. Ezri had a blast, James got to play a few great rounds of dodgeball with the older kids, and I discovered just how bad I am at slack-lining. Ezri is anxious to go again, of course.

We went with Emily for a drive up to Frankenmouth, Michigan once the weather got a little less cold. The town was founded by German immigrants, so there is some really interesting architecture and it's a bit of a tourist trap. We didn't make it through too much of the town, as we spent entirely too much time and money in a board game shop we found, but it was definitely a fun trip.

We went with David and Cindy to the Toledo Zoo. Ezri is always excited to see the fish, and we were really looking forward to the petting zoo area. She was a little scared of the goats and alpacas, but we did get her to touch them a few times.

When the weather warmed up a bit more we drove out to Monroe, Michigan on the edge of Lake Erie to play on the beach. We found a tree that had recently been cut down before it fell down, and Ezri had fun hiding in the stump.

Easter weekend was colder than we'd hoped, but we were lucky to find an egg hunt event we could participate in. They did it a little different, most of the eggs were empty and only a few had tickets for prizes. We didn't get any tickets, but we did get a bag of candy for collecting at least one egg, and then sponsors handed out other goodies on the way back to the car. The opportunity for Ezri to interact with adults other than us was great, she likes talking to other adults but her volume is so quiet they almost never hear her, especially through the mask.![ezri_egg](ezri_egg.jpg)

Speaking of Ezri and talking, over the last few months she has decided she is a cat. We're sometimes struggling to get her to use any words other than 'meow', which makes for hilarious (to me) episodes of her crying meows at James while he tries to figure out what's keeping her from going to sleep at bedtime. Her cat name changes frequently, often just made up names, but she's got a favorite she likes to use: 'Pompom'. We have considered adopting a cat, but with  the size of the RV and Daisy's history of chasing cats, we decided instead to get a hamster, that Ezri has named Mango. Mango loves running around the RV in her hamster ball, and Ezri spends entirely too much time at night watching Mango instead of letting herself go to sleep.

Over the winter we only got serious snow twice, but we made sure to enjoy it when we got it. Spending the winter here was a bit of test to see if we can handle it after so many years in the desert, and I think this was a more mild winter than normal, but overall we are feeling a-ok with living in an area that gets cold and snowy. I did have a bit of what I suspect to be Seasonal Affective Disorder, but a little vitamin D seemed to clear it right up.

The timing barely worked, but before leaving the area, we were able to get both doses of our COVID vaccines. The first we just had some arm soreness, but the second dose hit me pretty hard with chills and a fever of 102. James was just a little tired, so it worked out that he was able to keep Ezri happy while I recovered. Still well worth the safety, obviously. While we were waiting for the vaccines, James also had to get a little dental surgery for his front teeth, luckily the timing worked out for that and we were able to get all the appointments taken care of before leaving the area. It's certainly nice to have a friend in the industry (Cindy) to help keep us taken care of!

On May 1st we left out to the first stop for this year, Athens, Ohio. We're moving every two weeks this year, and unlike past moves, we've had to schedule all the way out to October because of the increased park demand.
