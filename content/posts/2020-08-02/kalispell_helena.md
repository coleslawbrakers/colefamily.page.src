### Kalispell, Montana

Kalispell is definitely a contender for us, it has friendly people and beautiful landscapes. The weather proves to a be a little unpredictable: due to the mountains in the area, high winds whip through periodically and the weather can change rapidly. One day we went from blue sunny skies to high winds, rain, and hail within about 3 hours. Definitely makes for some excitement, but also some frustration; we got all dressed for a bike ride one morning only to have it start raining the second we got in the saddle.

Speaking of bike riding, we finally got everything in place to go on a family ride. Due to the spike in demand for bicycles, we had a heck of a time finding the bike trailer we wanted for Ezri. It allows her to pedal while also being more of a chair with safety straps so we can be sure she won't fall off. We only went for 10 miles as we didn't want to push either Ezri or myself too hard, but it was very enjoyable, and she definitely wants to go more often.

The bike trails made for excellent runs, walks, and rides. We're going to miss them now that we've left the area. Unlike in some places we've been, the trails are quite long and decently interconnected. Kila, which is about 15 miles outside of Kalispell, could be reached by cycling trails from where we stayed. If we decide to move to the area, Kila is probably where we'd end up settling. It's a very small town, with 20+ acre parcels available for good prices, and still easy to access the amenities of Kalispell nearby.

While checking out the area, we came across a Fire Station fund-raiser, and were able to climb inside some of the fire trucks. Ezri had a blast pretending to drive, but was disappointed they weren't going to let us take them for an actual spin.

We visited the 'Miracle of America' museum, which had a little of everything to look at. We felt like we could have come back and spent another 10 hours and still likely not seen everything. One of our favorite things was some working Nickelodeon pianos they had that still accepted quarters, and a boat ride that worked on dimes.

Glacier National Park is one of the reasons a lot of people would see Kalispell, we drove up one day, but unfortunately the best part of the park, 'Going to the Sun Road' was closed. We still visited the beach of the river for a while, and Ezri had a lot of fun playing in the sand and water.

The day before we had to leave town, James got up super early and rode his bike up the 'Going to the Sun Road', as they allow bicycles while it is still closed to cars. It was about 42 miles round trip, but the steep part was 3000 feet of climing in 10 miles. You can see his [Strava ride here with a lot more pictures](https://www.strava.com/activities/3747732304) than just those below.

The day after we left Kalispell, they opened the rest of Glacier to cars. I'm bummed I missed seeing the best parts, but glad James was able to do his epic bike ride before we left.

### Helena, Montana

![helena_a](helena_a.jpg)Next stop was Helena, Montana, for 2 weeks. This one was added by me, as looking online, I thought this was a real potential candidate. Helena is the capitol of Montana, and was at one point the richest city in the state due to successful mining operations. There are some beautiful old houses and buildings in their downtown area, and they have a walkable section that is closed off to cars and lined with cute shops and restaurants. We bought a few more games for Ezri than we probably should have at a toy store there, and I bought a half pound of chocolates at a chocolate shop that I'm now trying to not to eat all at once.

Helena has an average of 300 sunny days a year, so it's dry and the natural vegetation tends more towards sagebrush than trees or grasses. Some of the lots we looked at were up at the edge of the mountains and reminded me a lot of Mt. Charleston outside of Las Vegas.

I took Ezri to the Black Sandy State Park on the edge of Lake Helena and spent a few hours in the water. She was having a great time until she went a little too far out, slipped, and dunked herself. Even so, anytime we go near or mention any kind of water, she wants to go dip her toes in.

Unfortunately, while Helena was nice and the people were friendly, it was just too deserty. While there, though, we heard from multiple people that we HAD to check out Bozeman, Montana. We were able to finagle the schedule, and that is our next stop.
